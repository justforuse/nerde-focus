# NerdeFocus Chrome Developer Tools Extension

> **Fork**
This is a fork of the original [NerdeFocus Chrome extension](https://github.com/wizzyfx/nerdeFocusPlugIn), updated to support Manifest V3. The original extension was built on Manifest V2, which is being deprecated by Chrome.



NerdeFocus is a Developer Tools extension that allows you to debug focus problems when testing a page for accessibility issues. When activated, it will display the focus history with CSS selectors, and animate the focus ring.

NerdeFocus is great for detecting focus resets, testing focus order and debugging screen reader issues with modern web apps.
